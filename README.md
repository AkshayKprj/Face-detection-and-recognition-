# Face-detection-and-recognition-
A face detection and recognition project uses machine learning to identify and verify human faces. It employs algorithms like OpenCV for detection and models such as Haarcascade for feature extraction and recognition.

**Steps:**
Run Face Dataset python file.
Then Run Training python file.
Atlast Run Face Recognition python file.
